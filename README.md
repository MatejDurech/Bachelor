The Bachelor thesis is focused on optimizing the operation of a group of elevators.
The aim of the thesis is to design a simulation system that will control operation
of elevators and transport of people to the floors where they want to go with
minimizing the waiting time for the elevator and the time spent in the elevator.
We used the following algorithms for optimization: the nearest car method, fuzzy
logic and the random search optimizer to optimize fuzzy logic. When comparing
the efficiency of the algorithms, we used the metric we created (how many steps
in the simulation pass on average before one elevator passes between the two
floors).
